    "Indigenous people are the people who have inhabited a land area from the earliest times, before colonization, and have a way of life that is *inextricably linked* to that land. Over many thousands of years and more, indegenous folks learn and pass down wisdom about how humans can best support the local ecosystem they are a part of and depend on. This wisdom is sometimes called \"Traditional Ecological Knowledge\" (TEK). Invasion by colonization across the world has caused many genocides of indigenous people and their lands, and has attempted to erase indigenous culture and TEK.

For this reason, Karuk and Yurok people (and many others indigenous peoples) refer to their prescribed fire as *cultural burns* that are central to subsistence and ceremonial practices. The term *cultural burning* distinguishes these fires from the fuel reduction-focused *prescribed burns* of public land agencies whose primary objective is to reduce fuel loads and moderate wildfire intensity.
